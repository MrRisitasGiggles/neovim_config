<h1>Basic NeoVim setup</h1>

<h2>What the project does</h2>
<p>
  The project contains files that I am using to set up NeoVim.
</p>

<h2>Why the project is useful</h2>
<p>The project is useful because it serves as a template that I will use to adapt NeoVim over time.</p>

<h2>How users can get started with the project</h2>
<p>
  0. Download the three lua files.
  1. Place the "init.lua" file in your NeoVim configuration folder by typing ":echo stdpath("config") within NeoVim."
  2. Create a directory under the same path from (1) and name it "lua".
  3. Copy the "options.lua" and the "plugins.lua" files into the "lua" sub-directory from (2).
</p>

<h2>Where users can get help with your project</h2>
<p>
  There is unlikely to be any help from me because I don't know what I am doing.
</p>

<h2>Who maintains and contributes to the project</h2>
<p>
  Right now, only I contribute to the project.
